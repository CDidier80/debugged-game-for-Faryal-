Hi, Faryal - great job on your project! 

I fixed the irritating bug you guys were trying to solve regarding the behavior of your flipped variable. You happened to stumble into one of the most common and frustrating pitfalls that beginners deal with. Check out index.js. There's a breakdown of exactly what went wrong. Your code was excellent for a new programmer, so I hope you don't mind that I reworked a few functions for you to reference - and use if you like. As you continue to learn I hope you find it a valuable model for how to think about defining functions, separating concerns, and becoming a modular and semantic coder. There may be a few things you haven't seen yet, but over the next couple months you'll be able to look back and know exactly what's going on.

Good luck!
